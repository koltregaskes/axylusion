I create at the intersection of human imagination and artificial intelligence. Using tools like Midjourney, I craft cinematic portraits, dark fantasy worlds, and cyberpunk visions that blur the line between dreams and reality.

Every image in this gallery represents countless iterations - prompts refined, parameters tuned, and creative direction applied until the AI captures exactly what I envisioned. It's a collaboration between human creativity and machine capability.

Beyond still images, I explore AI-generated music with Suno and experiment with video generation tools like Runway and Pika. The AI creative space is evolving rapidly, and I'm documenting the journey.

## What I Create

- **Images** - Cinematic portraits, dark fantasy, cyberpunk, noir
- **Music** - AI-generated tracks exploring various genres
- **Videos** - Motion experiments and animated art
